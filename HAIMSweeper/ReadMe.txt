To run the game launch index.html

TODOs and possible improvements:
1. Make a separate Game class instead of onLoadGame
2. Move the logic related to Game state from GameField to this new class
3. Draw scores in the new class
4. Do something with coordinates (absolute and relative, for drawing and handling clicks)
5. Preload images in some better way than hiding them on the page (which one is best?)
